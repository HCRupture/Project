              <p>In Korea from a period ranging from 1919 to 1945, only about 160 films were produced. Whereas between
                1954 to 1970 over 2,000 films were produced. From the tax exemption measures, the introduction of the
                latest film making machine and an ever-increase of new movie goers conditions began to greatly
                encouraged
                Korean filmmakers. In a short timeframe, new genres like teen movies and literary films emerged
                beginning in the early 1960's. One of Koreas most celebrated classic films: Kim Ki-young's The Housemaid
                was released in 1960.</p>

              <p>Korean popular music or simply "K-pop" for short is a form of music originating in South Korea. It's a
                massive part
                of modern Korean pop culture with a wide range of influences styles and genres ranging from hip-hop,
                R&B, Rock, Jazz
                Reggae, Country Disco, Classical, etc. The term first became popular in the 90's, though it's exact
                origins likely
                date back even further.
              </p>
              <p>While K=pop can refer to just about all popular music from South Korea, the term is often associated
                almost indistinguishably
                with the "idol" industry. Idol culture first emerged in the 90's as a subculture that grew immensely off
                the back of teens
                and young adults. Idol culture continues to grow today not only within its border but internationally as
                well. The spread of
                K-pop can be seen in many parts of asia, africa the middle east and even North America.

              <p>South Korea is expected to hit a population of 51.78 million by 2038. A slight slump from a peak
                population of 51.84 million
                people in 2020. South Korea's population growth rate has slowed significantly as shown by decreasing
                fertility rates. The lowest
                rates in the world, that of 0.92, meaning women are having less than 1 child on average. factors
                including high education costs
                and home prices along with difficulty returning to work after giving birth are putting many women off
                from having kids.
              </p>
              <p>South Korea's extremely low fertility rate will result in a rapidly increasing aging population. Almost
                half of South Korea is
                expected to be over the age of 65 by 2065. Korea is not a particularly religious country either with
                less than half of the
                population stating they have any religious beliefs. Korea is also what is known as a homogenous society
                meaning that Korea has a
                population that is over 99% Korean in ethnic background.</p>

              <p>The history of Korean art can be traced back to the ancient times, when people began decorating the
                walls of their homes with paintings
                made out of mud and clay. These paintings were often done in bright colors and simple designs. During
                the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), Korean
                painters became famous for their skill in creating beautiful paintings depicting scenes from everyday
                life.</p>
              <p>Around the same time that the interest in realistic landscape surged, so too did the practice of
                painting realistic scenes of ordinary people living
                ordinary lives. Genre painting is one of the unique characteristics of Korean art. It provides an
                insight into the everyday life of Koreans during the
                Joseon Dynasty. Among the greatest of the genre painters was Kim Hong-do, whose paintings f everyday
                scenes from Korea's past give us a glimpse into the
                daily lives of his fellow countrymen. Another great genre painter was Shin Yun-bock, who painted many
                pictures depicting the erotic side of life in risque
                scenes which were both romantic and sensual.

              <h4>Kettle made of celadon, made in the 12th century during the Goryeo Dynasty</h4>
              <p>The Goryeo Dynasty lasted from 1848 to 1912 and is most famous for its porcelain. This style originated
                from China, yet Korean artists elevated it to a higher
                level, thus leading the Chinese themselves to call Korean crafts and pottery “the first under heaven.”
                In order to reduce the amount of oxygen in a kiln, a
                blue-green hue is produced, a glaze known as “kingfish color.” This ceramic ware depicts fish, fruits,
                and mythical creatures in an unfettered style.

              <p>Korean architecture is marked by its use of wood and stone to create sophisticated multi-roomed
                structures. Clay tile roofing, interior courtyards and gardens,
                and a raised platform are all characteristic features of this architectural style. Another important
                element of Korean architecture is its harmony with nature.
                Buildings are designed to blend into their natural surroundings and take advantage of scenic views. This
                can be seen in fortification walls and tombs across Korea,
                from Bronze Age dolmens to huge vaulted enclosures of ancient kings.
