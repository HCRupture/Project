              subsisted on hunting, fishing, and gathering. Roughly 200,000 primitive Megalithic structures, the oldest known structures to date, still remain on much of the

              is defined today from 57BC to 668AD and was founded soon after the fall of "Gojoseon" a powerful federation that had ruled over the northern korean Peninsula as far
               back as 2300 BC. The Three kingdoms govermental system was much of what it would remain for the entirety of ancient Korea. Within it's system, a monarch ruled on top
               surrounded with aid of dministrative officials whom where of aristocracy. The majority of the kingdom population were divided into peasantry and slaves. Slaves were
               the bottom of the social hierarchy and consisted of people whose origins were prisoners of war or criminals. Slaves usually worked for and on the estates of aristocracy.

            <p class="lead mx-auto">The Korean Empire was proclaimed in 1897 lasting until 1910. The coronation of King Gojong as Emperor Gwangmu in 1897 was followed by dramatic reform for a 
              series of events designed to raise the profile of the Korean Empire among the international community. During this brief period, Korea had some success in modernising many
               of its various industries including education, economy and its military. Many outside countries where all invested in Koreas future success and sought to influence it politically. </p>

          <h2 class="col">Annexation, War and Peace</h2>
            <p class="lead mx-auto">In 1910, the militarily occupied Korea was forced into the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty. Signed by Lee Wan-Yong, a General Power of Attorney by the Emperor. 
              However, many believe the Emperor is said to have not actually ratified the treaty. There is a long dispute whether this treaty was legal or illegal due to its signing 
              under duress, threat of force and bribes. Following Japan's surrender of WW2 in 1945, the United Nations developed plans for a trusteeship administration. The Soviet Union 
              were administered the northern peninsula of the 38th parallel with the south occupied by The United States. The politics of which, reulted in the 1948 establishment of 
              North and South Korea Respectfully. Following a Soviet-backet invasion from North into South Korea the Korean War broke out. The Korean peninsula remained divided And
              after 3 years of fighting throughout the nation, it was left effectively destroyed, especially in the cities. The conflict persists to this very day, even after the korean
              and the signing of the Armistice agreement, the 2 governments are still officially at war. As far off as 2018, the leaders of North and South Korea have signed the Panmunjom
              Declaration stating that they will work towards finding an end to their countries conflict.
