  <h1>Location</h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
      <p>South Korea is a country in East Asia in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula, located in both  the northern and eastern hemispheres of 
        the earth. South Korea occupies the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and borders the Sea of Japan to the east and the Yellow Sea to the 
        west. The southern edge of South Korea rests on the Korean Strait and the East China Sea.  The country itself is hilly and mountainous in the 
        east, where the Taebaek Mountains dominate the landscape. The Sobaek Mountains are found in the southern part of the country. 
      </p>
      <p>Coastal areas are formed as a result of mountain erosion and make up only 30 percent of the land area. The western and southern coasts of the 
        country are covered by thousands of islands and narrow channels; notable rivers are Kum, Han and Naktong. The country's highest point is at 
        Mount Halla-san, a 6,398-foot (1,950-meter) extinct volcano on Cheju Island.
      </p>
      <p>In 1955, many of the country's forests were cleared during and after World War II. Thanks to an active reforestation program, more than 65% 
        of South Korea's land is covered by forest; an increase up from 35 percent.

  <h1>Climate</h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
      <p>South Korea has a continental climate, with four distinct seasons. Winter is very cold and dry, while summer is hot 
        and humid. Spring and autumn are relatively short, but temperatures are mild and generally quite pleasant. This makes 
        these seasons some of the most comfortable times to visit South Korea.
      </p>
      <p>In South Korea, the seasons are very well defined and each one brings its own unique weather patterns. The year starts 
        off with a bang in late March/early April with the arrival of Springs. This season is generally quite short, but it's 
        still warm and humid due to the moist prevailing winds from the Pacific Ocean. Then, suddenly in late April, summer 
        arrives and can be quite harsh with high temperatures and intense humidity. The typhoon season runs from June to September, 
        but unlike other parts of Southeast Asia, South Korea doesn't experience massive typhoons.
      </p>
      <p>As the leaves begin to change color and the weather gets cooler, people in South Korea know that winter is on its way. In 
        the northern part of the country, winter usually arrives in late September or early October, but it may last until November 
        or December in the south. Although winters in South Korea can be quite cold, with temperatures sometimes falling below freezing, 
        they are not as harsh as in some other parts of the world. This is because there is little snowfall in most parts of the country. 
        The mountainous areas and the north may get some snow, but it is rare in the south and coastal regions.</p>

  <h1>Agriculture</h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <p>Only 22% of South Korea's land is arable, due to the prevalence of hills and mountains. Agriculture contributes a meager 
        2.34% to the country's GDP, but employs 7% of its workforce.Rice is the most important crop, accounting for nearly 90% of 
        grain production and over 40% of farm income. Other major crops include barley, soybeans, and potatoes. Fruit and vegetables 
        are also widely grown. Citrus fruits are particularly prevalent.

              <h3>Seoul</h3>
              <p>In the heart of South Korea lies its capital, the bustling metropolis of Seoul. A city where ancient tradition 
                meets modern convenience, visitors can find everything from high-tech subways and skyscrapers to Buddhist temples 
                and street markets. Highlights include the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a cutting-edge convention hall with curving 
                architecture and a rooftop park, Gyeongbokgung Palace - which once housed over 7,000 rooms - and Jogyesa Temple, 
                home to ancient locust and pine trees.

              <h3>Gyeongbokgung Palace</h3>
              <p>Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most famous landmarks in South Korea. The largest of the five residences of the 
                Joseon Dynasty, it was built in 1395 but destroyed by fire during the Imjin War in the 1590s. After being abandoned for 
                centuries, restoration work began during the reign of King Gojong (1852-1919). With over seven thousand rooms, it took 
                a while to return the entire palace to its former glory!
              </p>
              <p>Now a collection of museums and historical sites surrounded by gardens and ancient stone pagodas, Gyeongbokgung Palace 
                is a must-see for any visitor to Seoul.  The Changing of the Guard ceremony, which takes place on the hour, every hour, 
                is a popular attraction at the palace.

              <p>Seoraksan National Park is one of the most popular tourist destinations in South Korea, famous for its beautiful scenery 
                and unique rock formations. The park is divided into three sections, with the outer Seorak being the most touristed and
